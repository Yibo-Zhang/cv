<!-- __Configurable SDN Firewall__

- We used Software Defined Networking (SDN) principles to create a configurable firewall using an OpenFlow enabled Switch.
- We wrote customized firewall configurations to allow or block traffic and implemented them in Mininet.
- We examined the contents of the IP and Protocol Headers using Wireshark. -->

__Deep Learning in Magnetic Material Reconstruction__

- Dataset Preparation: Generated random 3D magnetic structures with Julia, and projected them into 2D images from various angles for analysis.
- Image Processing and Analysis:
	1. Applied a projection algorithm to transform 3D magnetic structures into 2D pictures.
	2. Implemented an autoencoder to analyze input images in manifold space.
- Deep Learning Model:
	1. Built and trained a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using PyTorch, comprising a generator to predict 3D magnetic properties and a discriminator to differentiate real and synthetic structures.
	2. Developed a U-Net model for accurate magnetic structure predictions based on input images.
- GAN Optimization and Training:
	1. Assembled the GAN model using Keras, enhancing the interaction between the generator and discriminator.
	2. Utilized adversarial training techniques and computer clusters to accelerate the learning process.
- Results: Demonstrated the capability of GAN and U-Net models to predict and learn magnetic structure characteristics effectively from projected 2D images.

__Materials database__

- Web Crawling for DOI Extraction: Utilized JavaScript to efficiently extract paper DOIs from the magazine's website.
- DOI-Based Paper Download via API: Implemented an API integration to download scientific papers using their DOIs.
- Prompt engineering: Guided LLM to extract multi-dimensional data, including material names and materials property, from scientific papers, and structured the output into JSON format.
- Website Development with Integrated Login: Developed a website using FastAPI for the backend and Vue.js for the frontend, featuring an integrated login system.(https://magneticmaterials.org/)
