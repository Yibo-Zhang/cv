## Current Interests

I am interested in machine learning and data mining.

### Specializations

I specialize in machine learning, data mining, Linux, web development, big data, SQL, and data visualization.


## Computer Science Projects


__Analysis of Brazilian E-CommerceDataset by Olist__

- Our analysis focused on customer satisfaction and buying power.
- We used various data exploratory methodologies (e.g., descriptive analysis, regression model, sentiment analysis).
- Visualization techniques enabled by Tableau, Python, pandas, SQLite, Matplotlib, D3, and JavaScript.
- We analyzed geographic variation in Olist customers, types of merchandise, etc. to improve customer satisfaction and increase sales.
- We developed an algorithm for recommending customers.

__An Android App for Job Comparison__

- We created an Android app to help users compare job offers and find the most suitable job.
- We applied system design before implementation.
- We used the Unified Modeling Language (UML) to create the initial design based on the requirements.
- We designed and implemented the user interface.
- We used Java and Android Studio for developing the backend.
- We held weekly discussions with group members and committed our work on GitHub.
- We managed new features with new branches.
- We used unit and integration tests to ensure that our application works.

__Configurable SDN Firewall__

- We used Software Defined Networking (SDN) principles to create a configurable firewall using an OpenFlow enabled Switch.
- We wrote customized firewall configurations to allow or block traffic and implemented them in Mininet.
- We examined the contents of the IP and Protocol Headers using Wireshark.
